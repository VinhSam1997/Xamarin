# Xamarin
project for studying purpose
I will summarize what I have done and what features I have added to my game app: There are total 3 pages "home page, ready page, play page"
Home page: show the label of my app "Fruit Matching‚Äù. There are 2 buttons on the homepage, but I failed to create the score board feature, so this is just an empty button. the play button is linked with the ready page
Ready page: A textfeild allow player to enter their name and the OK button is linked the play page. The name entered from player will pass to the play page
Play page: There are eight boxes and when the player click on a box. It will show the fruit inside the box, then the player can click on the second box, if the fruit inside the first box is NOT the same with the fruit in the second box, the box will not open, so they need to find another box. If the fruit in the first box is the same with the second box, then the player will get 10 scores. When the time remaining go down to 0, player will lose, and the page is automatically turn back to the ready page.
